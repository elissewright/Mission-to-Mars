# Mission-to-Mars
## Analysis of Martian weather data 

### This was a two-part project which utilized Beautiful Soup and Python in order to scrape data about Mars. In part 1, we scraped data from [MARS Planet Science](https://redplanetscience.com/) in order to retrieve titles and preview text summaries of articles on the landing page, then created a database of this information with MongoDB. In part 2, Python was used to scrape information from a [Mars Temperature Data website](https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html) and evaluate weather trends on Mars, including minimum temperatures, atmospheric pressure, and length of days compared to earth time.
